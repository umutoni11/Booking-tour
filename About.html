       ABOUT US
        <P>In 2003, African Parks entered into a long-term agreement with the Rwandan Government,
            and the Barotse Royal
            Establishment (BRE) to manage Liuwa Plain and revitalise the park.
            “We have worked in close partnership with the DNPW. 
             the Barotse Royal Establishment for 18 years to
            enhance Liuwa Plain’s ability to generate benefits for people and wildlife.
            Thanks to the Zambian Government and the BRE’s commitment to this landscape, Liuwa has emerged as a parkot
            only hailed for the recovery of its wildlife numbers, but for its international tourism appeal.
            The reintroduction of wild dogs is a key milestone in this process of restoration, helping to build a
            valuable natural asset for Rwanda and a future for this iconic species in Africa” said James Milanzi,
            African Parks’ Regional Director of Conservation. </P></section> </div>
